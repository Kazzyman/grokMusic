Fyne’s Layout Magic
Here’s the culprit: Fyne’s container/layout system.
container.NewWithoutLayout:
For staffContainer, this means its children (lines, staffAreaTapped) use absolute positioning (e.g., line.Position1, circle.Move()). But staffContainer itself is still sized/positioned by its parent (content’s VBox).

container.NewVBox:
Stacks instruction, staffContainer, HBox, and feedback vertically. Width = window width (1000px); height = sum of children’s MinSize() or explicit sizes (if unconstrained).

container.NewHBox:
Aligns checkButton and resetButton horizontally, splitting the 1000px width.

When you call Resize() or Move() on an object inside a layout-managed container, the layout recalculates everything on render (parentWindow.ShowAndRun()), overriding your calls unless:
The layout respects manual sizes (e.g., layout.NewGridLayout() might).

You bypass layouts entirely (rare in Fyne apps).

Root Cause: Layouts trump manual positioning here. VBox and HBox are the puppet masters.

Implication: These lines are vestigial—safe to remove unless you change the layout approach.

::: Updated Code Suggestion
Remove the no-ops and comment why:

staffContainer := container.NewWithoutLayout(lines...)
// No Resize/Move—VBox in content overrides these!
/*
	// staffContainer.Resize(fyne.NewSize(1000, 1000)) // ::: Had no effect !!!
	// staffContainer.Move(fyne.NewPos(100, 100))     // meant to center the canvas (staff container) in the window // ::: Had no effect !!!
	/*
	::: NewWithoutLayout: This creates a container where you control object positions—but only for its children (like lines, staffAreaTapped). ...
	... The container itself is still subject to its parent’s layout. Parent Layout: staffContainer is inside content (a container.NewVBox()), which is in mainContainer 
	(a container.New(layout.NewVBoxLayout())). VBoxLayout stacks items vertically and sizes them to fit the available width (here, the window’s 1000px), ignoring your Resize() and Move().
	Override: When parentWindow.SetContent(mainContainer) renders, VBoxLayout says, “I decide your size and position, staffContainer—not you!” It stretches staffContainer to the 
	window’s width (1000px) and positions it based on its vertical stack order.
	*/
*/

instruction := widget.NewLabel(fmt.Sprintf("Click all %s notes...", targetNoteLetter))
// No Resize—VBox sets size based on text!
	// instruction.Resize(fyne.NewSize(1000, 100)) // ::: Had no effect !!!
	/*
	NewVBox Control: instruction is the first child of content (container.NewVBox()). VBox sizes its children to fit the container’s width (1000px from the window) and 
	sets their height based on preferred size (here, the label’s text height).
	Widget Behavior: widget.Label has an intrinsic size (MinSize()) based on its text content. Your Resize(1000, 100) is overridden by VBox, which respects MinSize() unless forced otherwise.
	No Manual Override: Fyne widgets in layouts ignore Resize() unless the layout explicitly allows it (e.g., with padding or spacers).
	*/
	
checkButton := widget.NewButton("Check", func() { ... })
// No Resize—HBox in content dictates button size!

resetButton := widget.NewButton("New Game", func() { ... })
// resetButton.Resize(fyne.NewSize(200, 100)) // dimensions of "New Game" button. // ::: Had no effect !!!, same reason as above

	// checkButton.Resize(fyne.NewSize(200, 100)) // Check button’s footprint. // ::: Had no effect !!!
	/*
	NewHBox Control: Both buttons are in container.NewHBox(checkButton, resetButton), a horizontal box layout inside content’s VBox.
	HBox Behavior: HBox distributes available width (1000px from VBox) among its children, respecting their MinSize() (text + padding for buttons). ...
	... Your Resize(200, 100) is ignored—HBox sets the size.
	Shared Space: The buttons split the 1000px width (e.g., ~500px each if equal), with heights from MinSize() (e.g., ~40px for button text).
	*/


Why It Still Works
staffContainer: Sized by VBox to 1000x1000-ish (staff height + padding), matching staffCanvas and staffArea (both Resize(1000, 1000)—those do work since they’re CanvasObjects inside NewWithoutLayout).

instruction: Fits naturally at 1000px wide, text height.

Buttons: HBox gives them equal footing, functional without your Resize().

Could They Ever Work?
Yes, if you ditch layouts:
No Layout: Make staffContainer the window’s sole content:

parentWindow.SetContent(staffContainer)
staffContainer.Resize(fyne.NewSize(1000, 1000))
staffContainer.Move(fyne.NewPos(100, 100))

Now they’d shift and size—but you’d lose instruction, buttons, and feedback.

Custom Layout: Write a layout.Layout to respect manual Resize()/Move()—overkill here.

For instruction and buttons, you’d need layout.NewMaxLayout() or spacers to force sizes, but VBox/HBox are simpler for your UI.

Takeaway: Fyne’s layouts are bossy—CanvasObject primitives (staffCanvas, staffArea) obey Resize(), but containers/widgets bow to their layout parents.
