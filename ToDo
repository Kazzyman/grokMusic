I scared myself with an issue with GOROOT, but that is now solved. But that last update intended to fix the issue of multiple 
notes at the same position resulting in the "extra" taps being counted as "wrong position" is still with us.  or not???

could ask grok again past 11:55pm 

So, I now think we are done here.
